# spring-pandas-project
Individual research project using data analysis through pandas analyzing VCT player and team data.

Topic

The topic of this individual project will be predictions for match outcomes and player performance for the upcoming international VALORANT tournament, Masters Toronto. VALORANT has long been one of my favorite videogames to play casually, and I enjoy watching the professional games when they are live. VALORANT is a 5v5 tactical shooter where two teams compete in a series of rounds, with the goal of either planting a bomb at a designated site (A or B) and defending it, or defusing it if the enemy team has planted it. Because of my love for the game, I want to combine that passion with this research project to make an interesting analysis of the professional scene.

Data

Data will be sourced from a website called vlr.gg. vlr.gg maintains all professional player and team data from every tournament in VALORANT's history. This make the website an excellent spot for sourcing data for this research project. Most of the website's data are placed into charts which can be extracted by inspecting the website's elements, copy-pasting the html code used to make the chart, and inputting the html code into a program that outputs a .csv file. This process will be used to acquire data from the most recent regional qualifiers for Masters Toronto.

Research Questions

VALORANT is a very dynamic game. A lot of variables can influence the outcomes of rounds and games. Because of this, there are so many different datapoints that I can analyze that could have an impact on rounds outcomes. These are some research questions that I have to help drive data analysis:
1. Who will win Masters Toronto?
2. Which region is sending the strongest teams to Toronto?
3. When do duelist players play well (i.e. what characters played with certain duelists tend to yield better performances)?
4. What teams could cause an upset at Toronto based on their strenghts and weaknesses?
5. Who is most likely to be the MVP of the tournament?
6. Which 2nd and 3rd seed teams can I predict to qualify for playoffs?
7. Is Trent likely to perform well with recent Tejo* nerfs and changes?
8. Which agents will see the highest pickrate at Toronto?
9. What’s the relationship between a team’s round-start economy and their likelihood of winning that round?
10. Which agent-team compositions on each map have the highest win-rate/round win-rate?
11. Is there a correlation between a player’s consistency and their team’s overall success?
12. How do regions differ by playstyle and round length?

I will try to use all this Data Analysis to make solid match and player predicitons for Masters Toronto. I also want to see if I can understand the game on a deeper level through the analysis. Before the tournament begins, I want to confidently put together predictions for all matchups that will take place and final tournament rankings. Maybe I'll bet on matches and make some proft...

Some terminology and additional information about VALORANT

-Duelist, Controller, Initiator, and Sentinel are the four roles of characters in VALORANT. 

1. Duelists specialize in taking 1v1 fights and creating space for the team.
2. Controllers deploy smokes and cut off certain lines of sight and angles.
3. Initiators have suportive utility to set their team up for encounters with the enemy.
4. Sentinels lock down sites and other areas of the map and watch for enemy flanks.

-VCT stands for VALORANT Champions Tour and is the global esports circuit.

-Professional VALORANT is played in a best of three or best of five format with a map veto where teams ban and choose maps to play.

-Masters Toronto is a tournament with 12 teams, 3 from each major VCT region---Americas, EMEA, Pacific, and China. The first seed from each region bypasses the group stage and qualifies for playoffs. The 2nd and 3rd seed from each region and placed into groups and the top 4 qualify for playoffs. Playoffs are double elimination.

-VALORANT is played on a variety of different maps with different layouts and bomb sites; there will be seven in rotation at Masters Toronto. Most professional teams tend to have better maps and worse maps. 

-VALORANT has a round based economy where players receive money at the end of each round to buy guns and utility for the next round. Teams receive more money (credits) for winning a round compared to losing. Teams receive more money for defusing/planting the bomb and getting kills in the round.
